### CucumberSwift
CucumberSwift is a lightweight Cucumber implementation for swift. It was born out of frustration with current iOS Cucumber implementations. The whole goal is to make it easy to install and easy to use, so please feel free to give feedback.

### Installation
#### Cocoapods
Add this line to your podfile:
```ruby
    pod 'CucumberSwift'
```

#### XCode
After you install CucumberSwift open the info.plist file of your **test** target. You'll want the set the `Principal Class` to `CucumberSwift.Cucumber`. If you prefer editing your plists from source it should look like this:
```xml
	<key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
	<string>CucumberSwift.Cucumber</string>
```

### How do I use it?
CucumberSwift is designed to be run with XCTest. To start implementing some step definitions extend Cucumber with the StepImplementation protocol.
```swift
import Foundation
import XCTest
import CucumberSwift

extension Cucumber: StepImplementation {
    public func setupSteps() {
        //Step definitions
        Given("Something (matches|matched)") { (matches, _) in
            //assuming match is "Something matched"
            print(matches[0]) //Something matched
            print(matches[1]) //matched
        }

        When("Something (matches|matched)") { (matches, _) in
            //assuming match is "Something matched"
            print(matches[0]) //Something matched
            print(matches[1]) //matched
        }

        Then("Something (matches|matched)") { (matches, _) in
            //assuming match is "Something matched"
            print(matches[0]) //Something matched
            print(matches[1]) //matched
        }

        And("Something (matches|matched)") { (matches, _) in
            //assuming match is "Something matched"
            print(matches[0]) //Something matched
            print(matches[1]) //matched
        }

        But("Something (matches|matched)") { (matches, _) in
            //assuming match is "Something matched"
            print(matches[0]) //Something matched
            print(matches[1]) //matched
        }

        MatchAll("Something (matches|matched)") { (matches, _) in
            //assuming match is "Something matched"
            print(matches[0]) //Something matched
            print(matches[1]) //matched
        }
    }
}
```

### Generated step stubs
Writing regex can be a pain, rather than make you look up everything CucumberSwift will help you out by generating swift code with stubs for step definitions

### Hooks
CucumberSwift comes with 6 hooks, Before/After Feature Before/After Scenario and Before/After step, use them like so
```swift
import Foundation
import XCTest
import CucumberSwift

extension Cucumber: StepImplementation {
    public func setupSteps() {
        BeforeFeature { feature in

        }
        
        AfterFeature { feature in
            
        }
        
        BeforeScenario { scenario in
            
        }

        AfterScenario { scenario in
            
        }

        BeforeStep { step in
            
        }

        AfterStep = { step in
            
        }
    }
}
```

### Tags
You can specify what tags are supposed to be run by using the environment variable `CUCUMBER_TAGS`. This can be set by going to edit scheme -> test -> environment variables. Pass in a comma delimited list of tags to run.

### Data Tables
There are two categories of data table, one of them is in a scenario outline

#### Examples:
Examples let gherkin handle the data for you, individual scenarios are created that iterate over the table and inject the values
```gherkin
Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
        
    Background:
        Given I am logged in
    
    Scenario Outline: <user> logs in # 1st: Dave, 2nd: Bob
        Given a user named <user> # 1st: Dave, 2nd: Bob
            And a password <password> # 1st: hello, 2nd: *%&#*#!!
        When <user> logs in # 1st: Dave, 2nd: Bob
        Then <user> sees <account balance> # 1st: $0, 2nd: $20,000

        Examples:
            | user  | password | account balance |
            | Dave  | hello    | $0              |
            | Bob   | *%&#*#!! | $20,000         |
```

#### Test Data:
Test data can be attached to a step and is handed off to the step implementation to deal with.
```gherkin
    Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
        Scenario: minimalistic
            Given a simple data table
            | foo | bar |
            | boz | boo |
```
This can be accessed with CucumberSwift with an optional dataTable property on the step object
```swift
import Foundation
import XCTest
import CucumberSwift

extension Cucumber: StepImplementation {
    public func setupSteps() {
        Given("^a simple data table$") { (_, step) in
            let dt = step.dataTable!
            let row = dt.rows[0]
            print(row[0]) //foo
            print(row[1]) //bar
        }
    }    
}
```

### What's Still Missing?
- Gherkin language errors
- Rules
- Docstrings
- AND support for tags (currently when multiple tags are passed in it's treated as OR)
